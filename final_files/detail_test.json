The programme also welcomes functional experts whose success depends on understanding the business as a whole and individuals with potential for future senior management\u00a0roles.\u00a0This programme qualifies for the\u00a0INSEAD Certificate in Global Management.To further embed your learning, the Management Acceleration Programme now includes optional online learning. Should they wish, participants are able to enrol on our Open Online Programme, Design Thinking and Creativity for Business.To help organisations address today\u2019s business challenges in innovative ways, business leaders are seeking to develop their creative and design thinking skills. Indeed, as\u00a0you move up the organisation and into management, thinking creatively is an\u00a0essential skill that can help you innovate in any organisational context.\u00a0By elevating your creative skills, you will return to work able to develop and support a creative culture within your organisation.Design Thinking and Creativity for Business will help you\u00a0integrate creative and design thinking with your\u00a0business thinking for successful innovative problem-solving.The online programme will take place after the face-to-face component and should be attended within 18 months after completion of the face-to-face modules.Each week of content follows a very clear path to facilitate learning for busy executives. The platform allows participants to learn at their own pace during each week, by viewing the content, completing assignments and engaging in discussions, taking on average 3-5 hours per week to complete.The Management Acceleration Programme Selection ProcessThe Management Acceleration Programme features a rigorous selection process that is designed to put together a diverse class of talented and accomplish individuals from every function, every industry and from all over the world.Making the most of leadership development\u201cWe like to think that the learning happens in the classroom but that\u2019s not how learning happens when you return from a programme. When you leave a programme, you leave with two things: you leave with a set of insights. You also leave with a set of questions.\u201dWhy use simulations?\u201cSimulations allow us to acquire skills in an environment that is safe; that is risk free. It allows us to focus on the learnings rather than the results.\u201d Henrik Bresman, Associate Professor of Organisational Behaviour and Programme Director of the Management Acceleration Programme, on why we use simulations on programme.How do you learn leadership and management?Leadership and management is typically honed through experience. However, it is often difficult to find the space and time to reflect on the day-to-day.Participant Journeys: Nick Kennedy\u201cThe buzz that you get on the INSEAD campus. You can just feel this energy.
